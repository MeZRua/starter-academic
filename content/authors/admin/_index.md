I'm a first-year PhD student under the supervision of [Dr. XU Weitao](https://www.weitaoxu.com/) in Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong. I'm a member of Smart Sensing and Mobile Computing Lab (S2MC). My research interests include distributed machine learning and mobile computing. Prior to this I got my BEng and BEc degree in Computer Science and Financial Engineering at the Sichuan University.
